# A simple script that can be used in case the development machine doesn't
# have a ZFS pool thus no 'zpool' command available.
#
# Set the environment variable ZFSHOST to a valid host and put this folder in
# your PATH, then you should have a zpool command on your dev machine
#

e=$(ssh -q root@${ZFSHOST} zpool $@)
echo "$e"

# Below line can be used to fake a degraded pool
#echo "$e" | sed '1 s/ONLINE/DEGRADED/' | sed '2 s/ONLINE/DEGRADED/' | sed '10,11 s/ONLINE/UNAVAIL/'
# Below line can be used to fake capacity on pool (88% in this case)
#echo "$e" | sed -E 's/[0-9]+/88/'
